One of the main backbone of this system is database and here how to configure the database is explained. And the database used in this project is
MySQL. First create a database in any name as you want but i have created in the name of "rentalcar". In database.php change the user name
and password according to your requirement. In order to create the tables follow 2 screenshots of the database that is uploaded and create
table accordingly. In this project, after creating all the tables just add one row to the userinfo table where usertype will be superadministraor.
Superadministrator is the master of the system. He/She can appoint other administrator or driver. so follow this syntax in MySQL and
insert one row in the userinfo table. Here for example purpose i am assigning random names. The query to insert a superadministrator in the
database is "insert into userinfo values('name','password','email',phoneno,'address',pincode,'city','state','superadministrator');"
That's it. Ready to GO. For any problem feel free to ask.
